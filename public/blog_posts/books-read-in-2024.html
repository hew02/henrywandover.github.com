description: I have been slacking off for a few years now. Among this long list I consider losing my love for reading one of the worse offenders.

This part of my life has proven to be the most tumultuous. Some of the friends that were once apart of it are but strangers now, sometimes floating in but always quickly moving out. Along with the work involved with senior year, there is the additional stress of finding a job. Ideally starting a career in software, which I am slowly becoming less and less optimistic about. This isn&rsquo;t meant to give the impression of &ldquo;poor me,&rdquo; but illustrate a reason for my failure to read a substantial sum of literature.

Despite the date I&rsquo;m attempting to write this, this is not a &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Resolution.&rdquo; This is a promise to take things slower, and not treat every hiccup as dire. Novels and poetry are making a steady return into my life. This warms a part of my soul that longs for more than just interactions with cold membrane keys. As a result I&rsquo;m deciding to begin cataloging the books I read each year (perhaps if I have time I will attempt to resuscitate those titles deep in the recesses of my mind). Hopefully, this will inspire me to write more.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Heart of Darkness (1902) by Joseph Conrad</li>
<li>Existentialism and Human Emotions (1957) by Jean-Paul Sartre</li>
<li>Sacred and Terrible Air (2013) by Robert Kurvitz</li>
<li>A Farewell to Arms (1929) by Ernest Hemingway</li>
<li>The Old Man and the Sea (1952) by Ernest Hemingway</li>
</ul>

Onto another year.
