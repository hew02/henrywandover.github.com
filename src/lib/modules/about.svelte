<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	Hey there, welcome to my site! I'm Henry, a recent graduate of Bard College in the computer science program. 
	Currently residing in Philadelphia, I work on software projects related to programming languages 
	and desktop developer tools. Along with what I do in my free time, 
	I am also looking for work, ideally, either in backend software or game development. 
	If you have an opportunity, or know of one, feel free to check out my 
		<a href={resume} hreflang="en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" type="application/pdf">résumé</a>, 
	as well as the rest of my site.

	The ideal way of getting in contact is by email: <b>henrywandover[at]gmail[dot]com</b>. I don't
	really have much in the way of social media aside from
