<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
		I'm a recent graduate of Bard College in the computer science program. I currently live in Philadelphia, where I work on projects related to programming languages and useful desktop tools. Along with what I do in my free time, I am also looking for work, ideally, either in backend software or game development. If you have an opportunity, or know of one, feel free to check out my <a href={resume} hreflang="en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" type="application/pdf">résumé</a>, as well as the rest of my site.

<p>
	The ideal way of getting in contact is by email: <b>henrywandover[at]gmail[dot]com</b>. I don't
	really have much in the way of social media aside from
	<a
		aria-label="Social media link"
		href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrywandover/"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noreferrer noopener"
		title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a
	>
	(which I am not a huge fan of). There are more programming-related things on
	<a
		aria-label="Social media link"
		href="https://github.com/yung-turabian"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noreferrer noopener"
		title="GitHub">GitHub</a
	>
	and more artistic endeavours on my
	<a

		target="_blank"
		rel="noreferrer noopener"
		title="YouTube">YouTube</a
	>.

	As is tradition with personal sites, I have curated a page of external
	<a href="/links" title="Sites I Enjoy">sites</a> for a range of interests. Here's an extra one:
	meet my father, a
	<a href="https://mambomovers.com/Rondog.html">man of many words</a>.
