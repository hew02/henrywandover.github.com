            <h2>The Final Fumes of the Rutger's Teacher Strike</h2>
            <h4>
                From my field notes in the section titled:{" "}
                <i>Strike! at Rutgers University</i>
            </h4>
            <br />
            <p>
                The general gloom of being in New Jersey dissipated as we
                entered the campus apparatus. The deadly navigation along the
                New Jersey Turnpike was now behind me, well out of my mind for a
                few hours while I enjoyed the time at Rutgers. This fateful day
                happened to be the final fumes of a substantial fight for the
                typical labor demands—time and wage. Grad teachers and college
                professors, who were primarily in the humanities department,
                were on strike from teaching until the demands posed by the
                AAUP-AFT backed Rutgers’ union were met by administration. Much
                of the strikers anger was directed at the president Jonathon
                Holloway in particular, who had assumed the position of
                president of the college in 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
                The demonstration’s origin point was in front of a building that
                housed many classrooms. Unlike the ones at Bard in Olin Hall,
                these were falling in part in places and quite dismal looking.
                On the opposite hand the central Rutgers campus was beautiful.
                It was a sunny day which definitively aided in boosting peoples’
                moods at the cost of an increase in sweat. After grabbing a cup
                of coffee I joined in the circle of strikers, who were
                circulating physically and through a list of chants. I can’t
                recall exactly the wording but all the big topics were
                covered—solidarity, wage increases, benefits, and disgust with
                administration. It took me a while to get comfortable with
                shouting and singing along with everyone else. I’ve gotten over
                the fear associated with canvassing a while ago now. That’s
                second nature to me at this point. But this felt quite
                embarrassing to be following the person in front of me shouting
                things while students gave all of us looks. This would dissipate
                quickly, however, I stopped thinking in lines of just myself. No
                one knows who I am and even if they did I’m not in this alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                The campus was a shock to me after spending so much time at the
                small liberal arts college tucked away in Annandale. I’ve gone
                to Drexel University in my hometown many times to see friends
                and tour buildings. Both have a lot of similarities with rows of
                fraternity housing, chain restaurants as meal options, towering
                buildings that would make Olin Hall blush, and cut down the
                middle by a bustling main road that has to contend with over
                thirty-thousand students. Not only were we just at one of three
                Rutgers’ campuses but after speaking with a grad student in
                support of the strike I was informed of just how large alone
                Rutgers New Brunswick is. It’s like a mini city, existing by
                itself as its own ecosystem. According to another strike Rutgers
                is the largest landowner in New Brunswick and as a result
                affects the entirety of the city’s rent prices. Which signaled
                to me the wide reaching effects of such a large university like
                this and emphasizes the importance of workers to push back
                against such a beast.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the first part of the demonstration we did a little round
                robin dance as mentioned previously. My feelings of discomfort
                was due to my nature, that being I’m a very shy and closed off
                person. I feel comfortable at Bard and back home but it takes me
                some time to warm up, and until I do I can be quite awkward.
                During this part people were constantly honking at us in support
                and shouting appraisal out the window and that was huge boost in
                my confidence. I’m on the right side, not that, that was ever a
                real concern but it was more reassurance that I should be there.
                This was the final day of the strike and the approval of any
                passerby made me feel like it was worthwhile that I came down
                here as some degenerate communist agitator.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following part had us marching from the building we were
                posted out in front of to president Holloway’s office. Where
                once we arrived the brilliant union rep made herself fully
                visible. Perched on the steps of his office she echoed the
                frustration of every worker there today and earlier in the week.
                Her tough demeanor and rough way of speaking didn’t distract at
                all from her message. The way she pieced together sentence to
                sentence was eloquent in a way that I haven’t heard in a while,
                especially at a place like Bard. I thought of one person
                instantly who I hadn’t spoken to in a while, and ended up
                calling on the way back to the original site, was my grumpy old
                man who passes to me a long lineage of blue collar men and
                women, many of them strong union advocates. The gruffness and
                intellect reflects my dad in such a remarkable way. Both, the
                former I presume, are college educated but reject that pristine
                promise of comfortable job. My father has worked in social
                services for decades now, everything from assisting down-and-out
                veterans to helping at-risk youth study for their GEDs. His
                whole life he’s been struggling to stay above water and can’t
                help but drag up everyone he’s ever known with him. I assume
                that this union rep isn’t a perfect woman, neither is my father
                believe me, but they both seem to share a similar soul. A soul
                that only feels satisfied when others are thriving and those
                that constantly inflict pain and suffering below them deserve no
                second chances.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the AAUP-AFT representative's speech, workers who voiced
                concerns, more chants, and my call with the old bastard, we made
                a return to our origin. By this time I felt more in place and
                less like an unwanted and unneeded. parasite gripping to some
                gallant beast making its strides. This fight wasn’t to better my
                life, I didn’t have to do anything in any particular way. I just
                need to follow the leader and every grad students or adjunct is
                that leader. It’s something beautiful in a strange kind of a
                way. I don’t have to stand out I can just be there to show
                support and make the collective more intimidating to those who
                may try and squash us. After another round of chants it was time
                for the lunch break. I gathered a couple slices of cheese pizza,
                at this point a cliché practice of any kind of union gatherings,
                and plopped down in the shade. Talking a bit with a couple of
                teachers and my classmates that I came with, one of the teachers
                I found amusing due to his frying pan that he was constantly
                smacking throughout the chants with a flimsy spatula.
            </p>

            <p>
                More on the union itself, Rutgers AAUP-AFT is a merger between
                American Association of University Professors and American
                Federation of Teachers—the latter a subsidiary of the AFL-CIO.
                The union has been an institution since the early seventies,
                representing more than five-thousand workers and exists across
                all three universities in the Rutgers chain. On the day I
                attended the strike that seemed to be who was mainly attending,
                teachers of all brands. Yet it doesn’t stop there, this union on
                strike is just one part of the Coalition of Rutgers Unions that
                covers the multiple unions who represent over ninety-thousand
                kinds of workers at the universities. Honing in on the former,
                my knowledge of the organization comes from some teachers I
                spoke to there, an episode of The Dig, and their website. I
                didn’t learn any explicit details about their structure from
                either teachers or their rep, from the looks of how things were
                organized on this day it operates like any other local union.
                Decisions are reached through democratic decision making and the
                representative from the national helps guide them along a path
                and keep them in contact with the whole union community. Based
                on some of the speakers I’m gathering that this isn’t some
                symbolic collective either. The most vocal of the grad students
                took the stage on Holloway’s steps are voiced clearly their
                frustrations with their jobs. Members who turn out aren’t here
                to just show solidarity, they are active participants who are
                willing to ‘fight’ for better conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s hard to gauge first-hand the full potential of the strike
                as the day I attended was the terminal point. The union’s
                members, according to one adjunct, who maintained the strike
                were mainly those in the humanities department. I can’t say why,
                perhaps its due to the subject of their teaching or less
                security associated with that department. The union’s base when
                it comes to teachers, aside from a few exceptions, is grad
                students who are teaching and adjunct professors. Professors
                with tenure are secure and don’t feel the need to step off their
                platform and help a cause that doesn’t affect them directly. The
                former group of university teachers are slammed with huge
                teaching loads, dismal pay, and no certainty that they have a
                path forward. I’ve heard from my mother the stress that this
                kind of job induces. For a few years she was teaching at three
                different universities as an adjunct professor, having to grade
                thousands of papers a semester. The workload was overwhelming
                and she struggled to be there for students to build connections.
                The pay was crummy, and with no path revealing itself her she
                tapped out. My dad was also an English teacher and recounts
                similar stories. This is to say that a professors union will
                often drag into its ranks those dancing on that thin line
            </p>

            <p>
                The main goal of the union is its members but along with that is
                the improvement of the whole institution. When its educators are
                compensated fairly and treated well, the students will inherent
                the benefits of such a deal. Relationships between teacher and
                student can prosper without a crushing schedule of classes that
                are forced upon adjuncts and the like. Providing teachers not
                only a path forward but the ability to teach better with
                clarity. I could see that with many undergraduates who turned up
                to the strike in solidarity with their overworked comrades.
                Striking is one powerful tool of the union, however, there are
                many more that can be employed when banded together. Collective
                bargaining at the negotiation table for fair contracts helps to
                construct a good faith relationship between boss and worker.
                It’s tried and true method that has been in effect since the
                great steel strikes of a yesteryear. Although it’s not the
                idealized blue collar coal miner with soot caked into his face,
                they are all one great big family of workers. It was effective
                then and it proves itself today to still hold true. Think Akira
                Kurosawa’s Ran, where the father demonstrates the power of a
                bundle of arrows as opposed to just solitary one. Friday was the
                final day of the strike and through sheer collective power they
                won a new contract. While it primarily an economic renegotiation
                which entailed higher pay, it’s still without a doubt a victory.
                The flexing of worker power is force to be reckoned with.
            </p>

            <p>
                The strike’s choreography was led in large part by the union
                representative but not in an authoritarian sense. Those
                outspoken strikes who felt something deep inside of them and
                wanted to shout it out stepped out of line. Be it the adjunct
                before with his frying pan or a fellow Bard student who gripped
                the loudspeaker with assurance. He hadn’t led a chant before but
                it didn’t seem like it all, he seemed like a natural, most
                likely due to empathy. We were a well oiled machine and we
                achieved what the organizer set out to do.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, I was slightly disappointed to be honest. I long for
                the days of a strike where it was less a dance as Francis Fox
                Piven says it and more of an actual fight. It’s not necessarily
                because of an aggravated yearning to enact violence on the
                oppressors. But because I feel that nonviolence protest is a way
                muzzling the true hidden power of the working class. It’s an
                invention of the liberal rebirth and active framing of history.
                Look at the Civil Rights Era, we praise MLK (not to tarnish him
                in anyway) for nonviolence and establish that as the ‘correct’
                way to protest the powers at be. We now often forget Malcom X
                and when he is remembered there is often disdain by liberals who
                criticizes the violence that he championed. It’s misconstrued as
                structureless violence because to the upper class it’s a
                horrifying thought that the underclasses become aware of the
                power they have. The same was echoed during the George Floyd
                protests with all the talks of senseless violence and
                destruction which again upset the balance and struck fear into
                the hearts of the oppressive class. Piven is right when she begs
                that we shouldn’t continue to follow this “narrow path of
                nonviolence.” We made great gains before in little time and I
                believe it’s still always going to be possible if handled in an
                uncomfortable way. Revolution won’t be served on a silver
                platter, it’s going to come raw on a blood-stained paper towel.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of all my prior field trips, I found the strike at Rutgers to be
                the most rewarding. Part of it due to the happy ending with the
                workers celebrating a victory over Holloway and administration.
                I felt like I had just participated in something truly
                important, even if I had just played a small supporting role. I
                made the strike just one person bigger but maybe that wasn’t
                something that was needed. On the drive back to Bard I was
                thinking about how to get involved further into the labor
                movement—not that I wasn’t always thinking about that. But I
                really want to attend more strikes even if they aren’t the
                knuckle-busting battles of the past, they still have that
                collective essence that is hard to come by nowadays. It also
                reassured my goal of becoming a labor organizer because it’s
                evident that the small victories of a few workers are so close
                in reach. Unlike For The Many which focuses their efforts on
                organizing around pressure on elected candidates. Union
                organizing is all about a tiny local community but that
                community as I saw at Rutgers is truly organized. It didn’t feel
                so orchestrated like a For The Many event, it felt so natural
                with students walking to and fro talking to teachers on strike.
                No one, not even the paid union rep, talked in a way like they
                just got back from a training retreat.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m quite jealous of Rutgers, they have what seems to be such a
                lively community surrounding workers’ rights. People are versed
                in theory and in practice when it comes to organizing. I doubt
                many had to take a class when it comes assisting in a campaign
                for you fellow human. That’s really all labor organizing is,
                improving the conditions of work because it would lighten the
                load of you and your friends and comrades. If there ever again
                is a strike I’d be more than happy to return.
