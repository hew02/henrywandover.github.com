    I have been slacking off for a few years now. Among this long list
    I consider losing my love for reading one of the worse offenders.
    Despite the date I'm attempting to write this, this is not a "New Year's Resolution".
    Novels and poetry are making a steady return into my life, a fact that warms the
    part of my soul that longs for more than interactions with cold membrane keys.
    As such I'm deciding to begin cataloging the books I read each year
    (perhaps if I have time I will attempt to resuscitate those deep in the recess).
